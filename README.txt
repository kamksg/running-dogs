OMFGDOGS!

I have successfully implemented a web page that
       Loops an mp3 file and plays on page load.
       Has an animated gif that covers the entire web browser
       Gives credit to the original page omfgdogs.com at the bottom right

Pattra A. helped me push the files onto the git repository

I spent about an hour completing this lab.
